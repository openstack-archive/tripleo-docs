Release Management
==================

Releases Overview
-----------------

Before reading this document and being involved in TripleO release management,
it's suggested to read the OpenStack Release Management guide_.

.. _guide: https://docs.openstack.org/project-team-guide/release-management.html

Most of TripleO projects follows the independent_ release model.
We will be creating stable branches based on our long term supported releases
going forward. The details can be found on the releases repository_.

.. _repository: https://opendev.org/openstack/releases/src/branch/master/deliverables/_independent

.. _independent: https://releases.openstack.org/reference/release_models.html#independent

All information about previous releases can be found on https://releases.openstack.org.
This page will document the process of releasing TripleO projects.

The tagging convention can be discussed with the PTL or the Release Liaison of TripleO.

For puppet-tripleo, we also need to update metadata.json file::

    "version": "X.Y.Z",

For other projects, there is no need to update anything since the release will be ready by pbr.

.. Note::
   Puppet OpenStack modules release management is documented here:
   https://docs.openstack.org/puppet-openstack-guide/releases.html#how-to-release-puppet-modules

Once this is done, you can submit a patch in openstack/releases and per project to modify the YAML.
The openstack/releases project provides tooling to update these files. See the new-release_ command.
You can also update the yaml files manually as necessary.
Example with tripleo-heat-templates, edit deliverables/pike/tripleo-heat-templates.yaml::

    ---
    launchpad: tripleo
    release-type: python-pypi
    team: tripleo
    type: other
    repository-settings:
      openstack/tripleo-heat-templates: {}
    releases:
      - version: 15.0.0
        projects:
          - repo: openstack/tripleo-heat-templates
            hash: 1ffbc6cf70c8f79cb3a1e251c9b1e366843ab97c
      - version: 15.1.0
        projects:
          - repo: openstack/tripleo-heat-templates
            hash: ec8955c26a15f3c9e659b7ae08223c544820af03
      - version: 16.0.0
        projects:
          - repo: openstack/tripleo-heat-template
            hash: <MY NEW HASH>

.. _new-release: https://releases.openstack.org/reference/using.html#using-new-release-command

Once the file is edited, you can submit it and OpenStack release team will review it. Note that the patch
requires +1 from TripleO PTL or TripleO Release Liaison_.

.. _Liaison: https://wiki.openstack.org/wiki/CrossProjectLiaisons#Release_management


The process of branching is also done by Release tools, and you need to change the YAML to
specify where we want to branch.
Example with tripleo-heat-templates, edit deliverables/ocata/tripleo-heat-templates.yaml::

    ---
    launchpad: tripleo
    release-type: python-pypi
    team: tripleo
    type: other
    repository-settings:
      openstack/tripleo-heat-templates: {}
    branches:
      - name: stable/xena
        location: 16.0.0
    releases:
      - version: 15.0.0
        projects:
          - repo: openstack/tripleo-heat-templates
            hash: 1ffbc6cf70c8f79cb3a1e251c9b1e366843ab97c
      - version: 15.1.0
        projects:
          - repo: openstack/tripleo-heat-templates
            hash: ec8955c26a15f3c9e659b7ae08223c544820af03
      - version: 16.0.0
        projects:
          - repo: openstack/tripleo-heat-template
            hash: <MY NEW HASH>

Keep in mind that tags, branches, release notes, announcements are generated by the tooling
and nothing has to be done manually, except what is documented here.


Releases for RDO
----------------

Due to TripleO's switch_ to the independent model, the TripleO project needs to
cut tags at the end of cycles that will not be supported in the long term. These
tags are used by the RDO release process to include a build of the TripleO
rpms in the RDO release.  The process to create the intermediate release would
be as follows.

.. _switch: https://specs.openstack.org/openstack/tripleo-specs/specs/xena/tripleo-independent-release.html

Update required metadata
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Some projects like puppet-tripleo and puppet-pacemaker require the metadata
be updated in the repository prior to cutting a tag. If the metadata is
not updated, the tagging patch to openstack/releases will fail CI.

For puppet-tripleo_ and puppet-pacemaker_, update the version information to
represent the next tag version (e.g. 16.1.0).

.. _puppet-tripleo: https://review.opendev.org/c/openstack/puppet-tripleo/+/813847
.. _puppet-pacemaker: https://review.opendev.org/c/openstack/puppet-pacemaker/+/813854


Get latest promoted content
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

After the previous metadata updates are available in the latest promoted content,
fetch the version information from RDO which contains the git repository hashes.

An example where this could be found is::

   https://trunk.rdoproject.org/centos8-master/current-tripleo/versions.csv

.. Note::
   You will needed to adjust the centos8 to centos9 as necessary.


Prepare version tags
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Based on the versions.csv data, an openstack/releases patch needs to be created
to tag the release with the provided hashes. You can determine which TripleO
projects are needed by finding the projects taged with "team: tripleo_".
`An example review`_.  Please be aware of changes between versions and create
the appropriate version number as necessary (e.g. major, feature, or bugfix).

.. _tripleo: https://opendev.org/openstack/releases/src/commit/fcdb1f5b556e99f25f248d38f16ad812489c9be0/deliverables/_independent/tripleo-heat-templates.yaml
.. _An example review: https://review.opendev.org/c/openstack/releases/+/813852

.. Note::
   If this is a long term release, this patch should include a stable branch.

Notify RDO team of tags
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Once the release has been created, make sure the RDO team not has been notified
of the new tags.  They will update the RDO release items to ensure that the
given openstack release will contained the pinned content.

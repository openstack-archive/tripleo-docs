Minor version update
====================

.. TOOD(aschultz): update to reference in the deploy guide
.. To get developer understanding of minor updates, first read the
.. :doc:`operator docs for minor updates <../../minor_update>`
.. and perhaps try to go through the update as an operator would, to get
.. the basic idea.

Assuming operator-level familiarity with the minor updates, let's look
at individual pieces in more detail.

How update commands work
========================

The following subsections describe the individual update commands:

* `openstack overcloud update prepare`_
* `openstack overcloud update run`_
* `openstack overcloud external-update run`_
* `openstack overcloud update converge`_

You might also find it helpful to consult this high-level diagram as
you read:

`openstack overcloud update prepare`
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The `update prepare` command performs a Heat stack update, mapping
some resources to ``OS::Heat::None`` in order to prevent the usual
deployment config management tasks being performed (running Puppet,
starting containers, running external installers like
ceph-ansible). See the `update prepare environment file`_.

.. _`update prepare environment file`: https://github.com/openstack/tripleo-heat-templates/blob/4286727ae70b1fa4ca6656c3f035afeac6eb2a95/environments/lifecycle/update-prepare.yaml

The purpose of this stack update is to regenerate fresh outputs of the
Heat stack. These outputs contain Ansible playbooks and task lists
which are then used in the later in the `update run` phase.

`openstack overcloud update run`
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The `update run` command utilizes the previously generated Heat stack
outputs. It downloads the playbook yamls and their included task list
yaml via the config-download mechanisms, and executes the
`update steps playbook`_.

.. _`update steps playbook`: https://github.com/openstack/tripleo-heat-templates/blob/4286727ae70b1fa4ca6656c3f035afeac6eb2a95/common/deploy-steps.j2#L558-L592

The command accepts ``--nodes`` or ``--roles`` argument to limit which
nodes will be targeted during a particular `update run`
execution. Even if the limit matches multiple nodes (e.g. all nodes
within one role), the play is executed with ``serial: 1``, meaning
that all actions are finished on one node before starting the update
on another.

The play first executes `update_steps_tasks.yaml` which are tasks
collected from the ``update_tasks`` entry in composable
services.

After the update tasks are finished, deployment workflow is
performed on the node being updated. That means reusing
`host_prep_tasks.yaml` and `common_deploy_steps_tasks.yaml`, which are
executed like on a fresh deployment, except during minor update
they're within a play with the aforementioned ``serial: 1`` limiting.

Finally, ``post_update_tasks`` are executed. They are utilized by
services which need to perform something *after* deployment workflow
during the minor update. The update of the node is complete and the
Ansible play continues to update another node.

`openstack overcloud external-update run`
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The `external-update run` command is used to update the services whose
deployment (and update) procedure is not tied to execution on
particular overcloud nodes. The deployment/update procedures are thus
executed from the undercloud, even though a full overcloud inventory
is available for use.

The `external update playbook` first executes `external_update_tasks`
and then `external_deploy_tasks`. The execution happens within the
same Ansible play, so facts from `external_update_tasks` are carried
over to `external_deploy_tasks`. This is a mechanism which will allow
you to amend what your deploy tasks do based on whether an update is
being run or not.

Often it's not desirable to run the tasks for all services at the same
time, so `external-update run` supports ``--tags`` argument to limit
which tasks are run.

The mechanisms of `external-upgrade` and `external-update` commands
and Ansible tasks are the same, but two commands and task hooks are
provided because generally in OpenStack we distinguish minor update
vs. major upgrade workflows. If your service only has one type of
upgrade, you can make the `external_update_tasks` the same as
`external_upgrade_tasks` by using YAML anchors and references.

.. _external update playbook: https://github.com/openstack/tripleo-heat-templates/blob/8fd90c2d45e2680b018eae8387d86d420f738f5a/common/deploy-steps.j2#L644-L699

`openstack overcloud update converge`
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
.. note::
    Update Converge is only required for versions less than Wallaby.
    Update Converge has been removed for Wallaby and beyond.
 
The `update converge` command performs a Heat stack update, reverting
the previous ``OS::Heat::None`` resource mappings back to the values
used for regular deployments and configuration updates, and
potentially also resets some parameter values. For environments with
Ceph, majority of this already happened on `ceph-upgrade run`, so the
final `update converge` effectively just resets the
CephAnsiblePlaybook parameter.

See the `update converge environment file`_.

.. _`update converge environment file`: https://github.com/openstack/tripleo-heat-templates/blob/4286727ae70b1fa4ca6656c3f035afeac6eb2a95/environments/lifecycle/update-converge.yaml

The purpose of this stack update is to re-run config management
mechanisms and assert that the overcloud state matches what is
provided by the templates and environment files.

Writing update logic for a service
==================================

Simple config/image replacement
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If the service is managed by Paunch_ or tripleo_container_manage_ Ansible role,
it may be that there's no need to write any update tasks. Paunch or
tripleo_container_manage can automatically handle simple updates: change in
configuration or change of container image URL triggers automatic removal of
the old container and creation of new one with latest config and latest image.
If that's all the service needs for updates, you don't need to create any
``update_tasks``.

Custom tasks during updates
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If the service is not managed by Paunch_ nor tripleo_container_manage_, or if
the simple container replacement done by Paunch is not sufficient for the
service update, you will need to include custom update logic. This is done via
providing these outputs in your composable service template:

* ``update_tasks`` -- these are executed before deployment tasks on the
  node being updated.

* ``post_update_tasks`` -- these are executed after deployment tasks on
  the node being updated.

.. _Paunch: https://opendev.org/openstack/paunch/src/branch/master/README.rst
.. _tripleo_container_manage: https://docs.openstack.org/tripleo-ansible/latest/roles/role-tripleo_container_manage.html

Update tasks are generally meant to bring the service into a stopped
state (sometimes with pre-fetched new images, this is necessary for
services managed by Pacemaker). Then the same workflow as during
deployment is used to bring the node back up into a running state, and
the post-update tasks can then perform any actions needed after the
deployment workflow.

Similarly as deployment tasks, the update tasks and post-update tasks
are executed in steps_.

Deployed Ceph
=============

In Wallaby and newer it is possible to provision hardware and deploy
Ceph before deploying the overcloud on the same hardware.

Deployed Ceph Workflow
----------------------

As described in the :doc:`../deployment/network_v2` the ``overcloud
deploy`` command was extended so that it can run all of the following
as separate steps:

#. Create Networks
#. Create Virtual IPs
#. Provision Baremetal Instances
#. Deploy Ceph
#. Create the overcloud Ephemeral Heat stack
#. Run Config-Download and the deploy-steps playbook

This document covers the "Deploy Ceph" step above. For details on the
other steps see :doc:`../deployment/network_v2`.

The "Provision Baremetal Instances" step outputs a YAML file
describing the deployed baremetal, for example::

  openstack overcloud node provision \
          -o ~/deployed_metal.yaml \
          ...

The deployed_metal.yaml file can be passed as input to the ``openstack
overcloud ceph deploy`` command, which in turn outputs a YAML file
describing the deployed Ceph cluster, for example::

  openstack overcloud ceph deploy \
          ~/deployed_metal.yaml \
          -o ~/deployed_ceph.yaml \
          ...

Both the deployed_metal.yaml and deployed_ceph.yaml files may then be
passed as input to the step to "Create the overcloud Ephemeral Heat
stack", for example::

  openstack overcloud deploy --templates \
          -e ~/deployed_metal.yaml \
          -e ~/deployed_ceph.yaml \
          ...

While the overcloud is being deployed the data in the
deployed_ceph.yaml file will be used to configure the OpenStack
clients to connect to the Ceph cluster as well as configure the Ceph
cluster to host OpenStack.

The above workflow is called "Deployed Ceph" because Ceph is already
deployed when the overcloud is configured.

Deployed Ceph Scope
-------------------

The "Deployed Ceph" feature deploys a Ceph cluster ready to serve RBD
by calling the same TripleO Ansible roles described in :doc:`cephadm`.
When the "Deployed Ceph" process is over you should expect to find the
following:

- The CephMon, CephMgr, and CephOSD services are running on all nodes
  which should have those services
- It's possible to SSH into a node with the CephMon service and run
  `sudo cepham shell`
- All OSDs should be running unless there were environmental issues
  (e.g. disks were not cleaned)
- A ceph configuration file and client admin keyring file in /etc/ceph
  of overcloud nodes with the CephMon service
- The Ceph cluster is ready to serve RBD

You should not expect the following after "Deployed Ceph" has run:

- No pools or cephx keys for OpenStack will be created yet
- No CephDashboard, CephRGW or CephMds services will be running yet

The above will be configured during overcloud deployment by the
`openstack overcloud deploy` command as they were prior to the
"Deployed Ceph" feature. The reasons for this are the following:

- The Dashboard and RGW services need to integrate with haproxy which
  is deployed with the overcloud
- The list of pools to create and their respective cephx keys are a
  function of which OpenStack clients (e.g. Nova, Cinder, etc) will be
  used so they must be in the overcloud definition. Thus, they are
  created during overcloud deployment

During the overcloud deployment the above resources will be
created in Ceph by the TripleO Ansible roles described in
:doc:`cephadm` using the client admin keyring file and the
``~/deployed_ceph.yaml`` file output by `openstack overcloud ceph
deploy`. Because these resources are created directly on the Ceph
cluster with admin level access, "Deployed Ceph" is different from
the "External Ceph" feature described in :doc:`ceph_external`.

The main benefits of using "Deployed Ceph" are the following:

- Use cephadm to deploy Ceph on the hardware managed by TripleO
  without having to write your own cephadm spec file (though you may
  provide your own if you wish)
- Focus on debugging the basic Ceph deployment without debugging the
  overcloud deployment at the same time
- Fix any Ceph deployment problems directly using either Ansible or
  the Ceph orchestrator tools before starting the overcloud deployment
- Have the benefits above while maintaining hyperconverged support by
  using a tested workflow

In summary, `openstack overcloud ceph deploy` deploys the Ceph cluster
while `openstack overcloud deploy` (and the commands that follow)
deploy OpenStack and configure that Ceph cluster to be used by
OpenStack.

Deployed Ceph Command Line Interface
------------------------------------

The command line interface supports the following options::

  $ openstack overcloud ceph deploy --help

  positional arguments:
    <deployed_baremetal.yaml>
                          Path to the environment file output from "openstack
                          overcloud node provision".

  optional arguments:
    -h, --help            show this help message and exit

                          The path to the output environment file describing the
                          Ceph deployment to pass to the overcloud deployment.
    -y, --yes             Skip yes/no prompt before overwriting an existing

                          The working directory for the deployment where all
                          input, output, and generated files will be stored.
                          Defaults to "$HOME/overcloud-deploy/<stack>"
    --roles-data ROLES_DATA
                          Path to an alternative roles_data.yaml. Used to decide
                          which node gets which Ceph mon, mgr, or osd service
                          based on the node's role in <deployed_baremetal.yaml>.
    --ceph-spec CEPH_SPEC
                          Path to an existing Ceph spec file. If not provided a
                          spec will be generated automatically based on --roles-
                          data and <deployed_baremetal.yaml>
    --osd-spec OSD_SPEC   Path to an existing OSD spec file. Mutually exclusive

                          defaults to {data_devices: {all: true}} for all
                          service_type osd. Use --osd-spec to override the
                          data_devices value inside the Ceph spec file.
    --container-image-prepare CONTAINER_IMAGE_PREPARE
                          Path to an alternative

                          ceph_namespace, ceph_image, and ceph_tag variables in
                          addition to registry authentication via
                          ContainerImageRegistryCredentials.

  container-image-prepare overrides:
    The following options may be used to override individual values set via
    --container-image-prepare. If the example variables below were set the
    image would be concatenated into quay.io/ceph/ceph:latest and a custom
    registry login would be used.

    --container-namespace CONTAINER_NAMESPACE
                          e.g. quay.io/ceph
    --container-image CONTAINER_IMAGE
                          e.g. ceph
    --container-tag CONTAINER_TAG
                          e.g. latest
    --registry-url REGISTRY_URL
    --registry-username REGISTRY_USERNAME
    --registry-password REGISTRY_PASSWORD

  This command is provided by the python-tripleoclient plugin.

Run `openstack overcloud ceph deploy --help` in your own environment
to see the latest options which you have available.


Ceph Configuration Options
--------------------------

The `deployed_ceph.yaml` Heat environment file output by `openstack
overcloud ceph deploy` has `ApplyCephConfigOverridesOnUpdate` set to
true. This means that services not covered by deployed ceph, e.g. RGW,
can have the configuration changes that they need applied during
overcloud deployment. After the deployed ceph process has run and
then after the overcloud is deployed, it is recommended to update the
`deployed_ceph.yaml` Heat environment file, or similar, to set
`ApplyCephConfigOverridesOnUpdate` to false. Any subsequent Ceph
configuration changes should then be made by the `ceph config
command`_. For more information on the `CephConfigOverrides` and
`ApplyCephConfigOverridesOnUpdate` parameters see :doc:`cephadm`.


Ceph Spec Options
-----------------

The roles file, described in the next section, and the output of
`openstack overcloud node provision` are passed to the
`ceph_spec_bootstrap`_ Ansible module to create a `Ceph Service
Specification`_. The `openstack overcloud ceph deploy` command does
this automatically so it is not necessary to use the options described
in this section unless desired.

It's possible to generate a Ceph Spec on the undercloud before
deployment by using the `ceph_spec_bootstrap`_ Ansible module
directly, for example::

  ansible localhost -m ceph_spec_bootstrap \
          -a deployed_metalsmith=deployed_metal.yaml

By default the above creates the file ``~/ceph_spec.yaml``. For more
information on the ``ceph_spec_bootstrap`` module run `ansible-doc
ceph_spec_bootstrap`. The spec file may then be edited if desired and
passed directly like this::

  openstack overcloud ceph deploy \
          deployed_metal.yaml \
          -o deployed_ceph.yaml \
          --ceph-spec ~/ceph_spec.yaml

All available disks (excluding the disk where the operating system is
installed) are used as OSDs as per the following default inside the
ceph spec::

  data_devices:
    all: true

In the above example, the `data_devices` key is valid for any `Ceph
Service Specification`_ whose `service_type` is "osd". Other OSD
service types, as found in the `Advanced OSD Service
Specifications`_, may be set by using the ``--osd-spec`` option.

If the file ``osd_spec.yaml`` contains the following::

  data_devices:
    rotational: 1
  db_devices:
    rotational: 0

and the following command is run::

  openstack overcloud ceph deploy \
          deployed_metal.yaml \
          -o deployed_ceph.yaml \
          --osd-spec osd_spec.yaml

Then all rotating devices will be data devices and all non-rotating
devices will be used as shared devices (wal, db). This is because when
the dynamic Ceph service specification is built whatever is in the
file referenced by ``--osd-spec`` will be appended to the section of
the specification if the `service_type` is "osd".

Service Placement Options
-------------------------

The Ceph services defined in the roles_data.yaml file as described in
:doc:`composable_services` determine which baremetal node runs which
service. By default the Controller role has the CephMon and CephMgr
service while the CephStorage role has the CephOSD service. Most
composable services require Heat output in order to determine how
services are configured, but not the Ceph services. Thus, the
roles_data.yaml file remains authoritative for Ceph service placement
even though the "Deployed Ceph" process happens before Heat is run.

It is only necessary to use the `--roles-file` option if the default
roles_data.yaml file is not being used. For example if you intend to
deploy hyperconverged nodes, then you want the predeployed compute
nodes to be in the ceph spec with the "osd" label and for the
`service_type` "osd" to have a placement list containing a list of the
compute nodes. To do this generate a custom roles file as described in
:doc:`composable_services` like this::

  openstack overcloud roles generate Controller ComputeHCI > custom_roles.yaml

and then pass that roles file like this::

  openstack overcloud ceph deploy \
          deployed_metal.yaml \
          -o deployed_ceph.yaml \
          --roles-data custom_roles.yaml

After running the above the compute nodes should have running OSD
containers and when the overcloud is deployed Nova compute services
will then be set up on the same hosts.

If you wish to generate the ceph spec with the modified placement
described above before the ceph deployment, then the same file may be
passed to a direct call of the ceph_spec_bootstrap ansible module::

  ansible localhost -m ceph_spec_bootstrap \
    -a "deployed_metalsmith=deployed_metal.yaml tripleo_roles=custom_roles.yaml"

Network Options
---------------

The storage networks defined in the network_data.yaml file as
described in :doc:`custom_networks` determine which networks
Ceph is configured to use. When using network isolation, the
standard is for TripleO to deploy two storage networks which
map to the two Ceph networks in the following way:

* ``storage`` - Storage traffic, the Ceph ``public_network``,
  e.g. Nova compute nodes use this network for RBD traffic to the Ceph
  cluster.

* ``storage_mgmt`` - Storage management traffic (such as replication
  traffic between storage nodes), the Ceph ``cluster_network``,
  e.g. Ceph OSDs use this network to replicate data.

``openstack overcloud ceph deploy`` will use the network_data.yaml
file specified by the ``--network-data`` option to determine which
networks should be used for the ``public_network`` and
``cluster_network``. It assumes these networks are named ``storage``
and ``storage_mgmt`` in the network_data.yaml file unless a different
name should be used as indicated by the ``--public-network-name`` and
``--cluster-network-name`` options.

It is necessary to use the ``--network-data`` option when deploying
with network isolation. Otherwise the default network, i.e. the
ctlplane network on the undercloud (192.168.24.0/24), will be used for
both the ``public_network`` and ``cluster_network``.


Example: Multiple subnets with custom network names
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

If network_data.yaml contains the following::

    - name: StorageMgmtCloud0
      name_lower: storage_mgmt_cloud_0
      service_net_map_replace: storage_mgmt
      subnets:
        storage_mgmt_cloud_0_subnet12:
          ip_subnet: '172.16.12.0/24'
        storage_mgmt_cloud_0_subnet13:
          ip_subnet: '172.16.13.0/24'
    - name: StorageCloud0
      name_lower: storage_cloud_0
      service_net_map_replace: storage
      subnets:
        storage_cloud_0_subnet14:
          ip_subnet: '172.16.14.0/24'
        storage_cloud_0_subnet15:
          ip_subnet: '172.16.15.0/24'

Then the Ceph cluster will have the following parameters set::

  [global]
  public_network = '172.16.14.0/24,172.16.15.0/24'
  cluster_network = '172.16.12.0/24,172.16.13.0/24'
  ms_bind_ipv4 = True
  ms_bind_ipv6 = False

This is because the TripleO client will see that though the
``name_lower`` value does not match ``storage`` or ``storage_mgmt``
(they match the custom names ``storage_cloud_0`` and
``storage_mgmt_cloud_0`` instead), those names do match the
``service_net_map_replace`` values. If ``service_net_map_replace``
is in the network_data.yaml, then it is not necessary to use the
``--public-network-name`` and ``--cluster-network-name``
options. Alternatively the ``service_net_map_replace`` key could have
been left out and the ``--public-network-name`` and
``--cluster-network-name`` options could have been used instead. Also,
because multiple subnets are used they are concatenated and it is
assumed that there is routing between the subnets. If there was no
``subnets`` key, in the network_data.yaml file, then the client would
have looked instead for the single ``ip_subnet`` key for each network.

By default the Ceph global `ms_bind_ipv4` is set `true` and
`ms_bind_ipv6` is set `false`.

Example: IPv6
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

If network_data.yaml contains the following::

  - name: Storage
    ipv6: true
    ipv6_subnet: fd00:fd00:fd00:3000::/64
    name_lower: storage
  - name: StorageMgmt
    ipv6: true
    ipv6_subnet: fd00:fd00:fd00:4000::/64
    name_lower: storage_mgmt

Then the Ceph cluster will have the following parameters set::

  [global]
  public_network = fd00:fd00:fd00:3000::/64
  cluster_network = fd00:fd00:fd00:4000::/64
  ms_bind_ipv4 = False
  ms_bind_ipv6 = True

Because the storage networks in network_data.yaml contain `ipv6:
true`, the ipv6_subet values are extracted and the Ceph globals
`ms_bind_ipv4` is set `false` and `ms_bind_ipv6` is set `true`.
It is not supported to have the ``public_network`` use IPv4 and
the ``cluster_network`` use IPv6 or vice versa.

Example: Directly setting network and ms_bind options
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

If the examples above are not sufficient for your Ceph network needs,
then it's possible to create an initial-ceph.conf with the four
parameters ``public_network``, ``cluster_network``, ``ms_bind_ipv4``,
and ``ms_bind_ipv6`` options set to whatever values are desired.

When using the ``--config`` option it is still important to ensure the
TripleO ``storage`` and ``storage_mgmt`` network names map to the
correct ``public_network`` and ``cluster_network`` so that the rest of
the deployment is consistent.

The four parameters, ``public_network``, ``cluster_network``,
``ms_bind_ipv4``, and ``ms_bind_ipv6``, are always set in the Ceph
cluster (with `ceph config set global`) from the ``--network-data``
file unless those parameters are explicitly set in the ``--config``
file. In that case the values in the ``--network-data`` file are not
set directly in the Ceph cluster though other aspects of the overcloud
deployment treat the ``--network-data`` file as authoritative
(e.g. when Ceph RGW is set) so both sources should be consistent if
the ``--config`` file has any of these four parameters.

An example of setting the four parameters in the initial Ceph
configuration is below::

  $ cat <<EOF > initial-ceph.conf
  [global]
  public_network = 'fd00:fd00:fd00:3000::/64,172.16.14.0/24'
  cluster_network = 'fd00:fd00:fd00:4000::/64,172.16.12.0/24'
  ms_bind_ipv4 = true
  ms_bind_ipv6 = true
  EOF
  $ openstack overcloud ceph deploy \
    --config initial-ceph.conf --network-data network_data.yaml

The above assumes that network_data.yaml contains the following::

  - name: Storage
    ipv6_subnet: fd00:fd00:fd00:3000::/64
    ip_subnet: 172.16.14.0/24
    name_lower: storage
  - name: StorageMgmt
    ipv6_subnet: fd00:fd00:fd00:4000::/64
    ip_subnet: 172.16.12.0/24
    name_lower: storage_mgmt

The above settings, which mix IPv4 and IPv6, are experimental and
untested.

Container Options
-----------------

As described in :doc:`../deployment/container_image_prepare` the
undercloud may be used as a container registry for ceph containers
and there is a supported syntax to download containers from
authenticated registries. By default `openstack overcloud ceph deploy`
will pull the Ceph container in the default
``container_image_prepare_defaults.yaml`` file. The version of the
Ceph used in each OpenStack release changes per release and can be
seen by running a command like this::

  egrep "ceph_namespace|ceph_image|ceph_tag" \
    /usr/share/tripleo-common/container-images/container_image_prepare_defaults.yaml

The `--container-image-prepare` option can be used to override which
``container_image_prepare_defaults.yaml`` file is used. If a version
of this file called ``custom_container_image_prepare.yaml`` is
modified to contain syntax like the following::

  ContainerImageRegistryCredentials:
    quay.io/ceph-ci:
      quay_username: quay_password

Then when a command like the following is run::

  openstack overcloud ceph deploy \
          deployed_metal.yaml \
          -o deployed_ceph.yaml \
          --container-image-prepare custom_container_image_prepare.yaml

The credentials will be extracted from the file and the tripleo
ansible role to bootstrap Ceph will be executed like this::

  cephadm bootstrap
   --registry-url quay.io/ceph-ci
   --registry-username quay_username
   --registry-password quay_password
   ...

The syntax of the container image prepare file can also be ignored and
instead the following command line options may be used instead::

  --container-namespace CONTAINER_NAMESPACE
                        e.g. quay.io/ceph
  --container-image CONTAINER_IMAGE
                        e.g. ceph
  --container-tag CONTAINER_TAG
                        e.g. latest
  --registry-url REGISTRY_URL
  --registry-username REGISTRY_USERNAME
  --registry-password REGISTRY_PASSWORD

If a variable above is unused, then it defaults to the ones found in
the default ``container_image_prepare_defaults.yaml`` file. In other
words, the above options are overrides.

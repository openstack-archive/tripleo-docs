Overcloud Major Upgrade Workflow and CLI
----------------------------------------

The purpose of this documentation is to deep-dive into the code which
delivers the major upgrade workflow in TripleO. For information about
the steps an operator needs to perform when running this upgrade
please see the `operator docs <major_upgrade_deploy_guide_>`_.

.. _major_upgrade_deploy_guide: https://docs.openstack.org/project-deploy-guide/tripleo-docs/latest/post_deployment/upgrade/major_upgrade.html

The major upgrade workflow is delivered almost exclusively via Ansible
playbook invocations on the overcloud nodes. Heat is used to generate
the Ansible playbooks (during the 'prepare' command at the beginning,
and 'converge' command at the end of the upgrade). The
Queens_upgrade_spec_ may be of interest in describing the design of
the workflow.

CLI code is in python-tripleoclient_, mistral workflows and actions in
tripleo-common_, and upgrade tasks in tripleo-heat-templates_. The
following sections dive into the details top-down per individual CLI
commands which are used to deliver the major upgrade:

* `openstack overcloud upgrade prepare $ARGS`_
* `openstack overcloud upgrade run $ARGS`_
* `openstack overcloud external-upgrade run $ARGS`_
* `openstack overcloud upgrade converge $ARGS`_

You might also find it helpful to consult this high-level diagram as

openstack overcloud upgrade prepare $ARGS
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The entry point for the upgrade CLI commands, *prepare*, *run* and
*converge*, is given in the python-tripleoclient setup.cfg_. All three
are also defined in the same file, overcloud-upgrade.py_.

The 'prepare' Heat stack update does not apply any TripleO
configuration and is exclusively used to generate the Ansible
playbooks that are subsequently invoked to deliver the upgrade.

As you can see the UpgradePrepare_ class inherits from DeployOvercloud_. The
reason for this is to prevent duplication of the logic concerned with validating
the configuration passed into the prepare command (all the -e env.yaml files),
as well as updating_the_swift_stored_plan_ with the overcloud configuration.

The prepare_env_file_ is automatically prepended to the list of
environment files passed to Heat (as specified by
prepare_command_prepends_). It contains resource_registry and
parameter_defaults which are intended to be in effect during the
upgrade.

As a result the UpgradePrepare class inherits all the Deploy_parser_arguments_,
including ``--stack`` and ``-e`` for the additional environment files. We explicitly
set the update_plan_only_ argument so that the Heat stack update does not get
executed by the parent class and returns after completing all the template
processing.

Instead, the Heat stack update is performed by a mistral workflow. On the
client side the hook is in the update method defined in package_update.py_.
This invokes the package_update_plan_ mistral workflow in tripleo-common.
The package_update_plan_ workflow has a number of tasks, one of which invokes
the heat stack update using the update_stack_action_.

Back on the tripleoclient side, we use base_wait_for_messages_  to listen
for messages on the Zaqar_queue_ that is used by the mistral workflow.

The operator must include all environment files previously used with
the `overcloud deploy` command. It is especially important that the
operator includes the environment file containing the references for
the target version container images.

See the `operator docs <major_upgrade_deploy_guide_>`_ for
pointers to how that file is generated and for reference it will look
something like

    .. code-block:: bash

       parameter_defaults:
         DockerAodhApiImage: 192.168.24.1:8787/queens/centos-binary-aodh-api:current-tripleo-rdo
         DockerAodhConfigImage: 192.168.24.1:8787/queens/centos-binary-aodh-api:current-tripleo-rdo
         DockerAodhEvaluatorImage: 192.168.24.1:8787/queens/centos-binary-aodh-evaluator:current-tripleo-rdo
         DockerAodhListenerImage: 192.168.24.1:8787/queens/centos-binary-aodh-listener:current-tripleo-rdo

Once the Heat stack update has been completed successfully and the stack is
in UPDATE_COMPLETE state, you can download the configuration ansible playbooks
using the config download cli


    .. code-block:: bash

       [stack@521-m--undercloud ~]$ source stackrc
       (undercloud) [stack@521-m--undercloud ~]$ openstack overcloud config download --config-dir MYCONFIGDIR
       The TripleO configuration has been successfully generated into: MYCONFIGDIR/tripleo-gep7gh-config

and you can inspect the ansible playbooks which are used by the *upgrade run*
before executing them.

openstack overcloud upgrade run $ARGS
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Unlike the first step in the workflow, the *upgrade prepare*, the UpgradeRun_
class does not inherit from DeployOvercloud. There is no need for the operator
to pass all the environment files and configuration here. The template processing
and update of the stack and swift stored plan have already taken place.
The ansible playbooks are ready to be retrieved by config download as demonstrated
above. The upgrade run operation thus will simply execute those ansible playbooks
generated by the upgrade prepare command, against the nodes specified in the
parameters.

Either ``--nodes`` or ``--roles`` parameters are used to limit the ansible
playbook execution to specific nodes. Both ``--roles`` and ``--nodes`` are
used by ansible with the tripleo-ansible-inventory_. This creates the
ansible inventory based on the Heat stack outputs, so that for example
``Controller`` and ``overcloud-controller-0`` are both valid values for
the ansible-playbook |--limit| parameter.

See `overcloud upgrade run <overcloud_upgrade_run_>`_ for additional information.

.. _overcloud_upgrade_run: https://docs.openstack.org/project-deploy-guide/tripleo-docs/latest/post_deployment/upgrade/major_upgrade.html#openstack-overcloud-upgrade-run

As documented in the major upgrade documentation and the nodes_or_roles_helptext_,
the operator *must* use ``--roles`` for the controllers. Upgrading the
controlplane, one node at a time is currently not supported, mainly
due to limitations in the pacemaker cluster upgrade which needs to
occur across all nodes in the same operation. The operator may use
``--roles`` for non controlplane nodes or may prefer to specify one or
more specific nodes by name with ``--nodes``. In either case the value
specified by the operator is simply passed through to ansible as the
limit_hosts_ parameter.

The ``--ssh-user`` and all other parameters are similarly
collected and passed to the ansible invocation which starts on the client side
in the run_update_ansible_action_ method call. The |--skip-tags|
parameter can be used to skip certain ansible tasks with the ansible-skip-tags_
ansible-playbook parameter. The allowed ``--skip-tags`` values are restricted
to a predefined set, validated against
MAJOR_UPGRADE_SKIP_TAGS_. Finally, the |--playbook| parameter as the name
suggests is used to specify the ansible playbook(s) to run. By default and
as you can see in the definition, this defaults to a special value 'all'
which causes all-upgrade-playbooks-to-run_. The value of all_playbooks
in that previous reference, is stored in the MAJOR_UPGRADE_PLAYBOOKS_ constant.

As with the *upgrade prepare*, for *upgrade run* a mistral workflow is used
to perform the 'main' operation, which in this case is execution of the
ansible playbooks. On the client side the update_nodes_workflow_invocation_
is where mistral is invoked and takes as workflow input the various collected
parameters described above. You can see that the update_nodes_workflow_ which
lives in tripleo-common has parameters defined under the 'input:' section which
correspond to the *openstack overcloud upgrade run* parameters.

There are two main tasks in the update_nodes_workflow_, the download-config_action_
which is invoked in a first 'download_config' task, and the ansible-playbook_action_
action which is invoked in the 'node_update' task. This is ultimately where
ansible-playbook-is-executed_ with processutils.execute.

Finally back on the client side we listen for messages on the run_zaqar_queue_
before declaring the upgrade-run-success_!

openstack overcloud external-upgrade run $ARGS
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The `external-upgrade run` command is used to upgrade the services
whose deployment (and upgrade) procedure is not tied to execution on
particular overcloud nodes. The deployment/upgrade procedures are thus
executed from the undercloud, even though a full overcloud inventory
is available for use.

The `external upgrade playbook` first executes
`external_upgrade_tasks` and then `external_deploy_tasks`. The
execution happens within the same Ansible play, so facts from
`external_upgrade_tasks` are carried over to
`external_deploy_tasks`. This is a mechanism which will allow you to
amend what your deploy tasks do based on whether an upgrade is being
run or not.

Often it's not desirable to run the tasks for all services at the same
time, so `external-upgrade run` supports ``--tags`` argument to limit
which tasks are run.

The mechanisms of `external-upgrade` and `external-update` commands
and Ansible tasks are the same, but two commands and task hooks are
provided because generally in OpenStack we distinguish minor update
vs. major upgrade workflows. If your service only has one type of
upgrade, you can make the `external_update_tasks` the same as
`external_upgrade_tasks` by using YAML anchors and references.

.. _external upgrade playbook: https://github.com/openstack/tripleo-heat-templates/blob/8fd90c2d45e2680b018eae8387d86d420f738f5a/common/deploy-steps.j2#L767-L822

openstack overcloud upgrade converge $ARGS
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The UpgradeConverge_ class like the UpgradePrepare class also inherits from
the DeployOvercloud_ class thus getting all of its parameters and template
processing. The operator needs to pass in all Heat environment files
used as part of the upgrade prepare including the container images file.

The main objective of the upgrade converge operation is to unset the
upgrade specific parameters that have been set on the overcloud Heat
stack as part of prepare. These are unset using the converge_env_file_
which is included in the list of client_converge_env_files_ passed to
the Heat stack update.

The 'converge' applies all TripleO configuration against all overcloud
nodes and thus serves as a sanity check that the overcloud was
successfully upgraded, since the same configuration will already have
been applied. The 'converge' will also leave the Heat stack in a good
state for subsequent updates, for instance scaling to add nodes.

As these values are set in parameter_defaults a Heat stack update is required
against the overcloud Heat stack to explicitly unset them. In particular and
as pointed out in the operator_converge_docs_ until converge has completed,
any operations that require a Heat stack update will likely fail, as the
'noop' of the DeploymentSteps in the prepare_env_file_ in particular means
none of the usual docker/puppet/* config is applied. Setting something with
parameter_defaults means it is used until explicitly unset via parameter_defaults
as that value will override any other default value specified via the
tripleo-heat-templates.

Unlike the prepare command there is no mistral workflow here and instead
we rely on the parent DeployOvercloud_ class to invoke the
converge_heat_stack_update_ and so the implementation is also simpler.

Upgrade CLI developer workflow
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This section will give some examples of a potential developer workflow for
testing fixes or in-progress gerrit reviews against python-tripleoclient,
tripleo-common or tripleo-heat-templates for the upgrade workflow. This
may be useful if you are working on an upgrades related bug for example.

Making changes to the ansible playbooks
.......................................

If there is a failure running one of the upgrades related ansible playbooks,
you might need to examine and if necessary fix the related ansible task.
The tasks themselves live in each of the tripleo-heat-templates service
manifests, under the upgrade_tasks section of the template outputs. For example
see the containerized rabbitmq_upgrade_tasks_.

If you make a change in service upgrade_tasks, then to test it you will need to

1. Patch the tripleo-heat-templates in your environment with the fix
2. Rerun `openstack overcloud upgrade prepare $ARGS`_, so that the resulting
   ansible playbooks include your fix.
3. Finally run the playbooks with `openstack overcloud upgrade run $ARGS`_.

Assuming you are using the default /usr/share/openstack-tripleo-heat-templates
directory for the deployment templates you can use the following as just one
example:

    .. code-block:: bash

       # backup tht in case you want to revert - or just yum re-install ;)
       sudo cp -r /usr/share/openstack-tripleo-heat-templates \
           /usr/share/openstack-tripleo-heat-templates.ORIG
       # Apply patch from gerrit e.g. https://review.opendev.org/#/c/563073/
       curl -4sSL 'https://review.opendev.org/changes/563073/revisions/current/patch?download' | \
           base64 -d | \
           sudo patch -d /usr/share/openstack-tripleo-heat-templates/ -p1

Making changes to the upgrades workflow
.......................................

If instead you need to add or fix something in the upgrades workflow itself,
for example to handle a new parameter needed passed through to ansible, or any
other change, you will need to patch python-tripleoclient and tripleo-common,
depending on whether your fixes extend to the mistral workflow too.

There are many ways to patch your environment and the following is a different
approach to the one used in the tripleo-heat-templates above where we patched
the installed templates in place. In the following examples instead we clone
tripleo-common and tripleoclient, patch them using gerrit reviews and then
re-install from source.

    .. note::

       The following example commands include complete removal and replacement
       of the installed tripleoclient and tripleo-common!

Patching python-tripleoclient:

    .. code-block:: bash

       # python-tripleoclient - clone source, patch from gerrit and install
       git clone https://github.com/openstack/python-tripleoclient.git -b stable/queens ~/python-tripleoclient
       pushd ~/python-tripleoclient

       # Apply patches from gerrit e.g. https://review.opendev.org/#/c/564267
       curl "https://review.opendev.org/changes/564267/revisions/current/patch" | \
             base64 --decode > /home/stack/"564267.patch"
       patch -N -p1 -b -z .first < /home/stack/564267.patch
       # Remove current version and re-install
       sudo rm -rf /usr/lib/python2.7/site-packages/python_tripleoclient*
       sudo rm -rf /usr/lib/python2.7/site-packages/tripleoclient
       sudo python setup.py clean --all install
       popd

Patching tripleo-common:

    .. note::

       After switching to containerized undercloud, local tripleo-common
       changes to be applied in all Mistral containers.

    .. code-block:: bash

       # tripleo-common - clone from source, patch from gerrit and install
       git clone https://github.com/openstack/tripleo-common -b stable/queens
       pushd ~/tripleo-common
       # Apply patches from gerrit e.g. https://review.opendev.org/#/c/562995
       curl "https://review.opendev.org/changes/562995/revisions/current/patch" | \
            base64 --decode > /home/stack/"562995.patch"
       patch -N -p1 -b -z .first < /home/stack/562995.patch
       # Remove current version and re install
       sudo rm -rf /usr/lib/python2.7/site-packages/tripleo_common*
       sudo python setup.py clean --all install
       popd
       sudo cp /usr/share/tripleo-common/sudoers /etc/sudoers.d/tripleo-common

Finally you need to update the mistral workbooks with the newly installed
versions. In code block above, the tripleo-common change at 562995_ has changed
package_update.yaml and so that is what we need to update here:

    .. code-block:: bash

       mistral workbook-update /usr/share/tripleo-common/workbooks/package_update.yaml
       # Since entry_points.txt is affected next steps are required:
       # Re populate mistral db and restart services
       sudo mistral-db-manage  populate
       sudo systemctl restart openstack-mistral-api.service
       sudo systemctl restart openstack-mistral-engine.service
       sudo systemctl restart openstack-mistral-executor.service

.. _rabbitmq_upgrade_tasks: https://github.com/openstack/tripleo-heat-templates/blob/master/deployment/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-messaging-rpc-pacemaker-puppet.yaml#L305
.. _562995: https://review.opendev.org/#/c/562995

Installing the Undercloud
==========================

#. Log in to your machine (baremetal or VM) where you want to install the
   undercloud as a non-root user (such as the stack user)::

       ssh <non-root-user>@<undercloud-machine>

   .. note::
      If you don't have a non-root user created yet, log in as root and create
      one with following commands::

          sudo useradd stack
          sudo passwd stack  # specify a password

          echo "stack ALL=(root) NOPASSWD:ALL" | sudo tee -a /etc/sudoers.d/stack
          sudo chmod 0440 /etc/sudoers.d/stack

          su - stack

   .. note::
      The undercloud is intended to work correctly with SELinux enforcing, and
      cannot be installed to a system with SELinux disabled.  If SELinux
      enforcement must be turned off for some reason, it should instead be set
      to permissive.

   .. admonition:: Baremetal
      :class: baremetal

      Ensure that there is a FQDN hostname set and that the $HOSTNAME environment
      variable matches that value.

      Use ``hostnamectl`` to set a hostname if needed::

          sudo hostnamectl set-hostname myhost.mydomain
          sudo hostnamectl set-hostname --transient myhost.mydomain

      An entry for the system's FQDN hostname is also needed in /etc/hosts. For
      example, if the system is named *myhost.mydomain*, /etc/hosts should have
      an entry like::

         127.0.0.1   myhost.mydomain myhost


#. Enable needed repositories:

  .. admonition:: RHEL
     :class: rhel

     Enable optional repo::

         sudo yum install -y yum-utils
         sudo yum-config-manager --enable rhelosp-rhel-7-server-opt

  Enable epel::

    sudo yum -y install epel-release

.. include:: ../repositories.txt

.. We need to manually continue our list numbering here since the above
  "include" directive breaks the numbering.

3. Install the yum-plugin-priorities package so that the Delorean repository takes precedence over the main RDO repositories::

     sudo yum -y install yum-plugin-priorities

#. Install the TripleO CLI, which will pull in all other necessary packages as dependencies::

    sudo yum install -y python-tripleoclient


#. Run the script to install the undercloud:

  .. admonition:: Baremetal
     :class: baremetal

     Copy in the sample configuration file and edit it to reflect your environment::

        cp /usr/share/instack-undercloud/undercloud.conf.sample ~/undercloud.conf

  .. admonition:: Source
     :class: source

     Git checkouts of the puppet modules can be used instead of packages. Export the
     following environment variable::

       export DIB_INSTALLTYPE_puppet_modules=source

  Install the undercloud::

      openstack undercloud install


Once the install has completed, you should take note of the files ``stackrc`` and
``undercloud-passwords.conf``.  You can source ``stackrc`` to interact with the
undercloud via the OpenStack command-line client.  ``undercloud-passwords.conf``
contains the passwords used for each service in the undercloud.  These passwords
will be automatically reused if the undercloud is reinstalled on the same system,
so it is not necessary to copy them to ``undercloud.conf``.

.. note::
    Any passwords set in ``undercloud.conf`` will take precedence over the ones in
    ``undercloud-passwords.conf``.

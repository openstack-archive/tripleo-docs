Scaling overcloud roles
=======================
If you want to increase or decrease resource capacity of a running overcloud,
you can start more servers of a selected role or delete some servers if
capacity should be decreased. This is now covered by the new Baremetal
provisioning process. Please refer to the following document for this node
scaling procedure :doc:`../provisioning/baremetal_provision`
